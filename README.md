# twitter-x_automate_accepting_message_requests
Automate accepting all message requests on your twitter account.
Good for automated accounts that need to accept multiple group requests at the same time.

# STEPS 
1. Navigate to: https://x.com/messages/requests
2. Open Dev tools, copy the Bearer token and put it in the script on the line 32
3. Open console and paste the script with the current Bearer token and click enter to run it.
4. Console will print out how many it accepted.
5. If there are more on the screen still after you run it, just run the function again by typing in: "main();" and clicking enter again.
